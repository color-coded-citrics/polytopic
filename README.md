# Polytopia Tribe Inspired Themes

This project is a collection of themes inspired by the tribes of Polytopia! Each theme is designed to capture the unique aesthetics of its respective tribe. At the moment, only Quetzali theme is available. I created this one as the initial theme because Quetzali is my favourite tribe but more themes are already in production!
